# Analitiq Connector Builder Plugin

Claude Code plugin that authors connector JSON documents conforming to the
published Analitiq schema contract at
[`schemas.analitiq.ai`](https://schemas.analitiq.ai). Supports API and database
connectors; storage kinds (`file`, `s3`, `stdout`) are accepted by the schema
but the engine doesn't yet execute them — those are stubbed.

## What it does

In the default `build` mode, given a provider name and an official
documentation URL, the plugin:

1. Researches the provider's auth model, transports, and endpoints.
2. Classifies kind, auth type, and transport types.
3. Dispatches a kind-specific creator agent that authors the connector body,
   the read/write type maps, and — for database connectors — the Python
   package files (dialect + connector class, requirements, pyproject).
4. Authors endpoint files alongside (API connectors only — DB endpoints are
   discovered at runtime).
5. Validates everything against the published JSON schemas plus a layer of
   semantic validators (DSN bindings, auth shape, TLS consistency, etc.).
6. Classifies version drift against the previous release and bumps `version`
   accordingly.
7. Writes the connector and endpoint files to disk at predictable paths.

**Usage:** Launch Claude Code and say *"build a connector for &lt;provider&gt;"*
or *"/connector-builder &lt;provider&gt;"*.

### Modes

The orchestrator runs in one of three modes (default `build`):

- **`build`** — author a fresh connector. Halts if a `{connector_id}/`
  directory already exists.
- **`update`** — an existing connector's upstream system changed:
  re-author from current docs and re-version by diffing the fresh draft
  against the existing connector. The existing connector is read **only**
  as the versioning baseline (never edited in place); the tree is
  regenerated and the version bumps from the prior release. Run inside a
  VCS checkout so the regeneration is reviewable via `git diff`.
- **`validate`** — read-only: validate an existing on-disk connector and
  report diagnostics, without researching, authoring, or writing. To fix
  findings, re-run in `update` mode.

## Architecture

```
connector-builder (skill, orchestrator)
├── connector-provider-researcher   # extracts ProviderFacts from official docs (WebSearch only to locate them)
├── api-connector-creator           # authors kind=api connectors (loads connector-spec-api)
├── db-connector-creator            # authors kind=database connectors (loads connector-spec-db)
├── endpoint-creator                # authors API endpoint documents
├── storage-connector-creator       # stub for kind ∈ {file, s3, stdout}
├── connector-schema-validator      # JSON Schema + semantic validation
└── connector-drift-classifier      # patch/minor/major bump from diff
```

The orchestrator owns classification and cross-cutting steps. Each creator
agent owns the authoring vocabulary for its kind via a dedicated spec skill
(`connector-spec-api`, `connector-spec-db`, `connector-spec-storage`).

## Supported kinds

| Kind | Status | Auth types | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api` | shipped | `api_key`, `basic_auth`, `oauth2_authorization_code`, `oauth2_client_credentials`, `jwt`, `credentials`, `aws_iam`, `none` | Stripe, Pipedrive, Wise, Xero |
| `database` | shipped | `db` | PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake |
| `file` / `s3` / `stdout` | stubbed | n/a | Recognized by schema; engine support pending. |

## Validation

The plugin includes a Python validator script
(`scripts/validate_connector.py`) that runs:

1. **JSON Schema validation** (Draft 2020-12) against the published schema:
   - Connector → `https://schemas.analitiq.ai/connector/latest.json`
   - Read map (`type-map-read.json`) → `https://schemas.analitiq.ai/type-map-read/latest.json`
   - Write map (`type-map-write.json`, database only) → `https://schemas.analitiq.ai/type-map-write/latest.json`
     (direction derives from the filename)
   - API endpoint → `https://schemas.analitiq.ai/api-endpoint/latest.json`
   - Database endpoint → `https://schemas.analitiq.ai/database-endpoint/latest.json`
2. **Semantic validators** for rules JSON Schema can't express:
   - `reserved-field`, `expression-resolver`, `phase-resolvability`,
     `transport-ref`, `dsn-binding`, `auth-shape`, `tls-consistency`,
     `type-map-coverage`, `type-map-rule`, `type-map-write-coverage`,
     `endpoint-annotations`.

   The validator checks JSON documents only; the database package files
   (`connector.py`, `pyproject.toml`, …) are enforced by registry CI.

Run directly:

```bash
python scripts/validate_connector.py \
  --schema-url https://schemas.analitiq.ai/connector/latest.json \
  --document path/to/connector.json
```

Output is a single `Diagnostics` JSON object. Exit 0 iff `passed: true`.

Tests live under `tests/connector_validator/`. Run with `pytest`.

## Schema host

- The validator fetches schemas from `https://schemas.analitiq.ai`.
- Authored documents declare `$schema` with the same host — the URL is
  locked by a `const` inside the published schema.

## File output

For each successfully built connector:

```
{connector_id}/
├── definition/
│   ├── connector.json              # the connector body
│   ├── type-map-read.json          # native → Arrow rules (required, non-empty)
│   ├── type-map-write.json         # Arrow → native DDL rules (database only)
│   └── endpoints/                  # api connectors only
│       └── {endpoint_id}.json      # filename matches the document's endpoint_id
├── __init__.py                     # database only
├── connector.py                    # database only — {Name}Dialect + {Name}Connector
├── requirements.txt                # database only — this connector's driver(s)
├── pyproject.toml                  # database only — analitiq-connector-{connector_id}
└── README.md
```

`connector_id` is the stable connector slug (`[a-z0-9_-]+`); the plugin
authors it into `connector.json` and uses the same value as the on-disk
directory name. Registry-stamped fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`) are
NEVER written to disk.

### Existing directories (build vs. update)

In **`build` mode**, if a directory matching the connector's
`{connector_id}` already exists in the current working directory, the
orchestrator halts and asks the user to remove it manually before
re-running. The plugin does not migrate legacy-shape connectors —
pre-existing files (with `placeholders` arrays or an embedded
`type_maps` block inside `connector.json`) must be deleted first so the
rebuild can produce a clean schema-aligned connector from scratch. The
orchestrator never deletes files on the user's behalf.

To refresh an existing connector after its upstream system changes, use
**`update` mode** instead: it reads the existing connector only as the
drift baseline, re-authors from current docs, and regenerates the tree
in place (review the result with `git diff`).
