# Changelog

## [unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial release of the standalone `analitiq-connector-builder` plugin,
  extracted from the `analitiq-ai/ai-plugins-official` monorepo into its
  own repository. Authors connector and endpoint JSON documents that
  conform to the published Analitiq schema contract at
  `schemas.analitiq.ai` (`kind: api` and `kind: database`; storage kinds
  `file`/`s3`/`stdout` are stubbed pending engine support).
- Agent chain: `connector-builder` (orchestrator skill) →
  `connector-provider-researcher` → `{api,db,storage}-connector-creator`
  → `endpoint-creator` (API, parallel) → `connector-schema-validator`
  (loop) → `connector-drift-classifier`.
- Orchestrator modes: `build` (default), `update` (re-author an existing
  connector from current docs and re-version it), and `validate`
  (read-only validation of an on-disk connector).
- `scripts/validate_connector.py` (Layer 1 JSON Schema + Layer 2 semantic
  validators) with the pytest suite under `tests/connector_validator/`.
