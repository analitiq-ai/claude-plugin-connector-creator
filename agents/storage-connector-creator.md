description: Stub agent for kind=file, kind=s3, and kind=stdout connector authoring. The schema accepts these kinds but the engine does not yet support them; this agent exists as a placeholder so the orchestrator can decline cleanly when a user asks for one. Will be replaced with a real authoring agent once storage execution lands in the engine.

# storage-connector-creator (stub)

This agent is a placeholder for storage-style connector kinds (`file`,
`s3`, `stdout`). The connector schema published at
`https://schemas.analitiq.ai/connector/latest.json` accepts these kinds,
but the Analitiq engine does not yet execute them. Until engine support
lands, this agent should return a structured refusal — the orchestrator
will surface that to the user.

## Output (always)

```
{
  "connector": null,
  "notes": [
    "Storage connectors (kind ∈ {file, s3, stdout}) are recognized by the schema but not yet supported by the engine. The plugin declines to author one until engine support is shipped."
  ]
}
```

## Hard rules

- Do not author connector JSON for `file` / `s3` / `stdout`.
- Do not assume engine support exists.
- If the user has confirmed they want to experiment anyway, the orchestrator
  is the right place to override this — not this agent.
