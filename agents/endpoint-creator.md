name: endpoint-creator
description: Author an endpoint JSON document for an API connector package, conforming to https://schemas.analitiq.ai/api-endpoint/latest.json. Invoked by the connector-builder orchestrator only when the connector kind is api, once per resource inside the endpoint fan-out. Multiple endpoint creators run in parallel — each authors one endpoint file. Inputs are the resource's researched EndpointFacts (its response field schema, including datetime zone-awareness) and the assembled connector document (for transport refs). Output is an EndpointCreatorOutput JSON object containing one endpoint document.

# endpoint-creator

You author one endpoint JSON document per invocation. You do not write to
disk — the orchestrator does that. You return an `EndpointCreatorOutput`
containing one endpoint document body.

## Required reading

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/connector-spec-api/spec-pagination.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/connector-spec-api/spec-replication.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/connector-builder/references/value-expressions.md`

## Inputs

- `endpoint_facts` — the `EndpointFacts` object for this resource (from
  this run's per-endpoint research pass): the resource's response field
  schema, with each field's `native_type`, `arrow_type`, nullability, enum
  domain, format, and — for temporal fields — a real `sample_value` and its
  `tz_aware` flag. Shape pinned in
  `connector-builder/references/io-contracts.md`.
- `connector` — the assembled connector document (for `transports`, `auth`,
  and `connection_contract` reference paths).

## Hard gate — no `endpoint_facts`, no authoring

An initial authoring dispatch MUST include `endpoint_facts` (the
`EndpointFacts` object from this run's per-endpoint research). If it is
missing, **do not author** — return a refusal naming the missing input and
stop. You have no web access and may not guess a resource's field types
(especially datetime zone-awareness); a user-described resource or an
assumption is not a substitute for researched facts. (Validator fix passes
are exempt: they arrive with `Diagnostics.findings` and your prior endpoint
document.)

## Fix pass

When the orchestrator re-dispatches you with a `Diagnostics.findings`
array (the validate→fix loop), you also receive the endpoint document
you produced on the prior pass. Triage each finding — you own the spec:

- **Real defect** → correct the endpoint document and return a fresh
  `EndpointCreatorOutput`.
- **Validator false positive** → leave the document unchanged and note
  your reasoning.

The orchestrator passes findings verbatim and never pre-judges or
pre-filters them — do not assume a finding is correct just because it
was raised.

## Process

1. Set `$schema` to `https://schemas.analitiq.ai/api-endpoint/latest.json`.
2. Set `endpoint_id` from `endpoint_facts.resource` — pattern
   `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$`. This is the endpoint document's stable
   identifier; the schema does not accept `alias` on endpoints.
3. Author `operations.read` when the resource is readable. Required keys
   are `request` and `response` (and inside `response`, both `records`
   and `schema` are required); `params`, `pagination`, `replication`
   are optional.
   - `request.method` (`GET` or `POST`) and `request.path` — from
     `endpoint_facts.method` / `endpoint_facts.path`.
   - `request.transport_ref` — only if not the default transport.
   - `request.query` / `request.headers` / `request.path_params` /
     `request.body` — declarative request shape. Values are
     value expressions (e.g. `{"ref": "connection.parameters.foo"}`).
   - `params` — declared operation inputs, each a `Param` with `in`
     (`query` / `header` / `path` / `body`), `type`, `required`,
     optional `default` (value expression), `operators` for filterable
     params, and `controlled_by` when pagination / replication owns it.
   - `pagination` — when `endpoint_facts.paginated` is true, populate per
     `endpoint_facts.pagination` (the connector-wide `style` + `params`,
     echoed into the branch — the API connector body carries no
     connector-level pagination, so this is your only source for it).
   - `replication` — only if the resource supports incremental sync; the
     cursor field is `endpoint_facts.replication_cursor`.
   - `response.records` — `ref` whose path starts with `response.body`,
     selecting the iterable record collection (use `endpoint_facts.record_path`).
   - `response.schema` — JSON Schema describing the response body, authored
     **from `endpoint_facts.fields`** — one typed property per field. For
     each field, the declared `arrow_type` is the field's
     `endpoint_facts.fields[].arrow_type` and the `native_type` annotation is
     its `native_type`. These are **not** two independent sources: the
     connector's `type-map-read` must render that `native_type` to a canonical
     **equal to** the declared `arrow_type` — the validator's
     `type-map-coverage` enforces exactly this. If they would diverge, the read
     map is wrong (a domain-level type-map fix, re-author + re-validate the
     domain), not the endpoint. Do not invent or guess field types — every
     type comes from the researched facts.
     - **Temporal fields follow the sample value, never a default.** A
       `date-time` field is *not* automatically tz-aware. Use the field's
       `tz_aware` flag (set by research from a real `sample_value`): a
       zoneless wire value → bare `Timestamp(<unit>)`; a value carrying an
       offset/`Z` → `Timestamp(<unit>, UTC)`. When two fields share a native
       token but differ in zone-awareness, give them **distinct** native
       tokens so each resolves to the right canonical under the read map's
       first-match-wins rules.
4. Author `operations.write` when the resource is writable
   (`endpoint_facts.writable`). `write` is a **mode-keyed map**; the schema
   accepts only `insert` and `upsert` as keys, and at least one mode is
   required when `write` is present. The
   two modes share the same block shape and differ only in
   `conflict_keys`. Each mode block holds:
   - `request` (required) — `method` (`POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH`), `path`,
     and the same optional `query` / `headers` / `path_params` / `body`
     / `transport_ref` keys as the read request.
   - `input` (required) — `{"schema": <JsonSchemaPropertyNode>}`
     describing one provider-facing destination record.
   - `conflict_keys` — **required for `upsert`, forbidden for `insert`.**
     An array of one or more strings, each a top-level field name
     declared in this mode's `input.schema`; together they are the
     provider-defined natural key the upsert matches on. For `insert`
     omit it (the schema pins it to `null`); an `upsert` without it
     fails validation. Use `endpoint_facts.conflict_keys` — the provider's
     documented idempotency / match key (e.g. an external id or a unique
     business key) — never invent one.
   - `batching` (optional) — `{"max_records": <int ≥ 2>}` when the
     provider documents a per-request cap.
   - `params` (optional) — same shape as read params.
   - `response` (optional) — write-result extraction. All keys
     optional; populate whichever the provider documents:
     - `affected_records` — value expression resolving to the count of
       impacted records.
     - `generated_keys` — value expression resolving to
       provider-assigned identifiers.
     - `error` — `{code, message, details}`, each a value expression,
       for failure parsing.
     - `metadata` — named value expressions for response metadata.
     - `success_when` — predicate determining operation success.
       Schema-closed set: `eq`, `neq`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`, `gte`,
       `exists`, `missing`, `empty`, `not_empty`, `and`, `or`, `not`.
5. At least one of `operations.read` or `operations.write` must be
   present. Omit the other when the resource is read-only or
   write-only.

## Hard rules

- Field types come **only** from `endpoint_facts` — never invent or default
  a field's `arrow_type` (datetime zone-awareness especially). The pagination
  / param / response vocabularies are owned by the live `api-endpoint` schema;
  when the spec prose and the schema disagree, the schema wins.
- Endpoint documents have no top-level `kind` field. The owning connector's
  `kind` selects the correct endpoint schema.
- Reuse the connector's transports via `request.transport_ref`. Never
  hardcode base URLs.
- Do not author database endpoints. Database endpoint shape is
  connection-scoped and produced by the connector's `resource_discovery`
  workflow at runtime, not by this sub-agent.
